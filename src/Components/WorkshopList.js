                                of design modelling! In this workshop, you will understand the 
                                importance of including modelling and simulations in your design 
                                projects, learn how to use Spaceclaim to create and improve your 
                                designs, and practice your skills with a small exercise. Looking 
                                forward to seeing you there!

                                    and non-static simulations. We will also discuss the valuable 
                                    information that you can extract from these simulations and then 
                                    wrap it up with an exercise. Looking forward to seeing you there!
